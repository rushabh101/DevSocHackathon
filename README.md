We created an app using Android Studio using Kotlin and Java, the app consists of two puzzles and a sleek UI which serves as a homepage.

Puzzle 1: Terminal Hacking
I am a really big fan of Fallout. The terminal hacking mini-game in it has always fascinated me. This is where my idea for an android clone stemmed from. I wanted to it make as close to the real thing as possible and made some modifications for the phone app. All rights are reserved by Bethesda.

Puzzle 2:
This puzzle was inspired by the Bioshock Hacking game, although it is not completely based on it. Also cats are cool, so those were integrated.
